<h1>This is a random walk</h1>
<p>
  From Wikipedia on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">Random Walk</a>:<br>
  A random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path that consists of a succession
  of random steps. For example, the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid
  or a gas, the search path of a foraging animal, the price of a fluctuating stock and
  the financial status of a gambler can all be modeled as random walks, although they may
  not be truly random in reality.
